### Minor Changes

- [#17](https://github.com/alirezahamid/schemat/pull/17) [`8db9c83`](https://github.com/alirezahamid/schemat/commit/8db9c8369c0cb6f916dcc89075d81b541f2fc481) Thanks [@alirezahamid](https://github.com/alirezahamid)! - Real-world Prisma robustness: parse schemas that don't statically validate but that Schemat can still render (it never connects to a database).

  - **Datasource without a static `url`** (e.g. `directUrl`-only, or url supplied at runtime) no longer errors with `Argument "url" is missing`. A harmless placeholder url is injected before validation and never used.
  - **Multi-file schemas** (`prismaSchemaFolder`: `prisma/schema/*.prisma`) are now detected and parsed — all files are concatenated.
  - **Monorepo discovery**: when no schema is found at the root, Schemat now scans `apps/*`, `packages/*`, `services/*`, `libs/*` and lists the sub-projects that contain a schema, telling you exactly which `--root` to pass.

  Verified against 7 large public schemas (cal.com 102 tables, dub 82, trigger.dev 77, langfuse 71, documenso 51, formbricks 49, umami 18).
